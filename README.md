# Tic tac toe game with minimax alfa-beta algorithm

With the help of the tkinter library I developed a a fun computer vs player Tic Tac Toe game.
You are able to play against the computer or AI, that uses minimax alfa-beta algorithm to to choose the best next step or position.
You are able to change the depth of the minimax tree aka. the difficulty. The depth tells how many moves ahead is the algorithm able to explore,
so the bigger it is the harder the difficulty
